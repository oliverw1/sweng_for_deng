    # Use these to answer the question: is the function correct?

    # Course participants should have at least one assertion here. Those that are
    # fairly new to testing will most likely create a test that checks the distance
    # between two coordinates which they looked up on the Internet, for example
    # checking in Google Maps what the distance is between Paris and Berlin.
    # While that test is okay, it puts more effort on the next programmer reading
    # your test, because he/she needs to look up that distance (few people know that
    # by heart). And, you have a reliance on a third party (in this case, Google Maps)
    # that that party was also correct. Sure, Google Maps is unlikely to be incorrect.
    # But consider that new services sometimes show issues too. Try to reduce reliance
    # on external parties and services in tests: keep things fairly simple, high-school
    # mathematics should still be fine.
    # If you did this, created a test involving distances between real locations on our
    # planet, do have a look at the non-trivial test below.

    # and cosines that are used in the Haversine formula, making them equal to
    # 0 or 1, which can be represented exactly on computers.
